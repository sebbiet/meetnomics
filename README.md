# Meetnomics 💰

> Because nothing says "productivity" like 12 people watching someone struggle with screen share.

Meetnomics is a satirical meeting cost calculator that helps teams visualize the true financial impact of their meetings. Watch in horror as the dollar signs pile up with each attendee you add!

## 🎯 Features

### Real-Time Cost Calculation
- Add attendees by name (or let us pick random ones)
- Each person gets a random hourly rate between $47-$245
- Adjust meeting duration from 30 minutes to 3 hours
- Watch the total cost update instantly

### Visual Feedback
- **Toast Notifications**: See +$XXX when adding and -$XXX when removing attendees
- **Milestone Alerts**: Get special notifications at every $500 increment
  - "Ouch! 😱", "Oomph! 😵", "Oh my lawd! 🤯" and more!
- **Meeting Cost Drawer**: A slick bottom drawer that makes you reconsider

### Enterprise-Ready Design
- Modern blue color scheme with glassmorphism effects
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Professional appearance with a humorous twist

### Integration Claims
We "integrate" with all your favorite tools (disclaimer: we don't actually):
- **Email Providers**: Outlook, Gmail, Google Workspace, Hey, Zoho Mail, ProtonMail
- **Payroll Systems**: ADP, Workday, Oracle Cloud HCM, SAP SuccessFactors, and more

## 🎭 How It Works
